# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T002` (rejected 1x): No project initialization files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `environment.yml`) or installation scripts are present, and there is no evidence that `torch` was installed with the required `--index-url` and version pinning. The required artifacts to prove the Python 3.11 project setup are missing.

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
