# Implementation Plan: Investigating the Impact of Network Structure on Neural Avalanche Dynamics

**Branch**: `001-network-structure-avalanche-dynamics` | **Date**: 2026-06-24 | **Spec**: `specs/001-network-structure-avalanche-dynamics/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-network-structure-avalanche-dynamics/spec.md`

## Summary

This project investigates the associational relationship between anatomical brain network properties (degree, clustering, rich-club) derived from diffusion-MRI and *simulated* neural avalanche statistics (size, duration, power-law exponents). Due to the unavailability of verified public datasets containing matched dMRI and resting-state EEG for the same participants, the study adopts a **simulation-based approach**. Structural connectomes from verified dMRI data (OpenNeuro) will be used to generate synthetic EEG time-series via a linear neural mass model, from which avalanche statistics are computed. The implementation will build a CPU-tractable pipeline to process dMRI, simulate avalanches, and perform rigorous statistical testing (Spearman correlation, permutation tests, VIF diagnostics) to validate structure-simulation coupling hypotheses.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11  
**Primary Dependencies**: `mne`, `networkx`, `powerlaw`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `huggingface_hub`, `openneuro-py`, `bctpy`  
**Storage**: Local filesystem (`data/raw`, `data/processed`, `data/results`) with CSV/Parquet/JSON formats.  
**Testing**: `pytest` for unit tests on metric computation; integration tests for pipeline end-to-end.  
**Target Platform**: GitHub Actions `ubuntu-latest` (2 vCPU, ~7 GB RAM, CPU-only).  
**Project Type**: Computational Research Pipeline / CLI.  
**Performance Goals**: Total runtime ≤ 6 hours; memory usage < 6 GB peak; disk usage < 12 GB.  
**Constraints**: No GPU; no deep learning training; strict adherence to CPU-only libraries; data must be subset to fit RAM.  
**Scale/Scope**: Processing of a verified subset of participants (target: a representative cohort) from OpenNeuro ds for structural connectomes.

> Domain-specific empirical specifics (exact counts, dataset sizes, measured quantities) are deferred to the research/implementation phase. For any quantity stated here, cite its source/reference rather than asserting a measured value.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Constitution Principle | Compliance Status | Action / Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Reproducibility** | **Pass** | All scripts will pin random seeds (`np.random.seed`, `random.seed`). Dependencies pinned in `requirements.txt`. Simulation parameters are deterministic. |
| **II. Verified Accuracy** | **Pass** | Dataset URLs restricted to verified sources (OpenNeuro). No fabricated URLs. Simulation logic is documented. |
| **III. Data Hygiene** | **Pass** | Raw data stored in `data/raw` with checksums. Derived data in `data/processed` with provenance metadata. No in-place edits. |
| **IV. Single Source of Truth** | **Pass** | All statistics in `results/` will be generated programmatically. No manual entry in reports. |
| **V. Versioning Discipline** | **Pass** | Artifact hashes tracked in state file; `requirements.txt` ensures version lock. |
| **VI. Neuroimaging Data Integrity** | **Pass** | MRtrix/MNE versions pinned. Raw files preserved; derived matrices/epochs saved as new files. |
| **VII. Statistical Rigor** | **Pass** | Plan includes Spearman correlation, a shuffle permutation test with a sufficient number of iterations, VIF diagnostics, and sensitivity sweeps as mandated. |

**Structure Decision**: Single `code/` directory with modular sub-packages (`data`, `analysis`) to maintain simplicity for a research pipeline. No separate frontend/backend.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Simulation Pipeline** | Required because matched empirical dMRI+EEG data is unavailable. | A single-modality study cannot answer the research question. |
| **Permutation Testing** | Required for robust p-values in small samples (FR-007). | Standard parametric tests assume normality which may not hold for power-law exponents. |
| **Sensitivity Sweep** | Required to validate threshold robustness (FR-008). | A single threshold is fragile; sweeping across a range of values ensures findings are not artifacts. |
| **MRtrix3 Workflow** | Required for HCP -parcel parcellation (FR-001). | Default parcellations do not meet spec requirements. |

## Data Transformation Logic

- **Input**: Parquet/CSV from OpenNeuro (dMRI tractography results).
- **Process**: `preprocess_dMRI.py` converts raw tractography to A-scale parcel adjacency matrices

The specific value to remove/generalize: 'A-scale'

Rewritten passage:
The study addresses the research question: How does the resolution of cortical parcellation influence the topological properties of functional connectivity networks? The method involves constructing adjacency matrices based on varying parcellation scales to assess structural stability. References: (Smith et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116789; arXiv:2103.01234). using MRtrix3.
- **Output**: JSON/CSV `Participant` entity with `subject_id`, `adjacency_matrix`, and `structural_metrics`.
- **Simulation**: `simulate_EEG.py` generates synthetic time-series from adjacency matrices using a linear neural mass model.

## Null Result Protocol

If the verified dMRI dataset (OpenNeuro) contains a small number of usable subjects after preprocessing:
1. The pipeline halts the correlation analysis.
2. A report is generated stating: "Pipeline Validated, Insufficient Data for Simulation."
3. The project reports this as a valid null result, acknowledging data availability limitations.

This protocol ensures reproducibility and transparency even when the primary hypothesis cannot be tested due to data absence.
