# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T016` (rejected 1x): The required artifact `data/results/timing_evidence.json` does not exist, and the provided `code/main.py` excerpt shows no implementation of start/end time logging, the < 6‑hour assertion, or generation of the JSON evidence. The task’s timing‑check and evidence‑generation requirements are therefore unmet.

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
