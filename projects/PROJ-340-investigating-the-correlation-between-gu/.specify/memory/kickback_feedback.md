# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T016` (rejected 1x): The provided `code/main.py` does not contain the required execution timing logic (logging start/end, asserting < 6 hours, exiting on timeout) and the expected artifact `data/results/timing_evidence.json` is absent. Both the code change and the evidence file are missing, so the task is not satisfied.

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
