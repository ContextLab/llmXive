# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T003` (rejected 1x): No linting/formatting configuration files (e.g., `pyproject.toml` or `setup.cfg` for Black, `.flake8` for Flake8, `.isort.cfg` or `pyproject.toml` section for isort) or a `.gitignore` file are present in the provided evidence. The implementer must add these concrete configuration files to the repository.
- `T007` (rejected 1x): declared artifact(s) missing/empty/invalid: schema.yaml
- `T008` (rejected 1x): declared artifact(s) missing/empty/invalid: schema.yaml

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
