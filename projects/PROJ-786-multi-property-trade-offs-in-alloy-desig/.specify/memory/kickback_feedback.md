# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T001` (rejected 1x): No evidence of the required `projects/PROJ-786-multi-property-trade-offs-in-alloy-desig/` directory tree or the `.gitkeep` placeholder files is present; the implementer’s claim is not backed by any actual artifacts on disk. The missing directory structure must be created and populated with the required placeholder files.

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
