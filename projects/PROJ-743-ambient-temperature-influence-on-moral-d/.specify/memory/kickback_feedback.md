# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T006` (rejected 1x): The required file `data/raw/era5_full.parquet` is missing, so the validation gate cannot pass, yet the log only shows per‑source “Pass” entries and does not record a final gate status (Pass/Fail). The task’s core requirement—to verify the file’s existence and log the overall gate result—is not satisfied.

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
