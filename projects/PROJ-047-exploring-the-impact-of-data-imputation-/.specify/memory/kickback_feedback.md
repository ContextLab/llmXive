# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T003` (rejected 1x): No linting or formatting configuration files (e.g., `.ruff.toml`, `pyproject.toml` with Black settings, or any scripts/CI steps) are present in the provided evidence, so the requirement to configure ruff and black for the `code/` and `tests/` directories is not satisfied. The implementer must add the appropriate configuration files and ensure they target the specified directories.

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
