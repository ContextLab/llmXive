# Execution failures — fix these before the analysis can run

## ⛔ HOLLOW RESULTS — the analysis RAN but MEASURED NOTHING

Every command exited 0 and the files were written — but the numbers in them are missing. A result that is `null`, `NaN`, an empty `[]`, a header-only CSV, or a column left blank in every row is NOT a measurement. Writing an empty result file is not 'done' — it is the same failure as fabrication, just quieter. You MUST:

1. Find WHY the value is missing. A `null`/`NaN` correlation almost always means the inputs were empty, misaligned, or the wrong column was read — fix the computation, do NOT paper over it with a default.
2. Verify you loaded the REAL dataset the spec names. If the study is about behavioural confidence ratings, a stand-in dataset (a bundled sklearn toy set, a random frame) is NOT the data — it will produce exactly these null/NaN results.
3. Make sure the key measure is actually POPULATED before you compute on it: if the column the study depends on is blank in every row, the extraction step is broken and that is the real bug.
4. NEVER self-certify. A `{"status": "PASS"}` written by your own code proves nothing; the numbers must be there.

- every produced artifact is gitignored (data/raw/networks/BA/metadata_BA_0000.json, data/raw/networks/BA/metadata_BA_0001.json, data/raw/networks/BA/metadata_BA_0002.json) — the run left NO durable evidence: nothing is committed for a reviewer to inspect or a paper to cite. Write the results a reader needs (e.g. data/results/*, figures/*) outside the ignored data/raw + data/processed dataset caches.

The analysis code was EXECUTED end-to-end (per quickstart.md) and FAILED. The project cannot reach research_complete until the run-book runs cleanly AND produces its declared data/figure artifacts. Fix the ROOT CAUSE of each failure below — do not stub, do not fake outputs, do not mark a task done until its script actually runs and writes its real output.

**Summary**: every produced artifact is gitignored (data/raw/networks/BA/metadata_BA_0000.json, data/raw/networks/BA/metadata_BA_0001.json, data/raw/networks/BA/metadata_BA_0002.json) — the run left NO durable evidence: nothing is committed for a reviewer to inspect or a paper to cite.

## ✅ VERIFIED REAL DATA SOURCE — use THIS in the data loader

Do NOT invent or guess a download URL/API (a hallucinated endpoint will 404). A real source was discovered AND verified by actually loading real data from it:

- **Install**: add `networkx` to the project's `requirements.txt` and `pip install networkx`.
- **Verified**: this loads **3** real records with fields: graph_id, graph_type, num_nodes, num_edges, seed, edge_list, node_attributes.
- **Working access recipe** (this EXACT code was executed and returned real data — base the loader on it):

```python
import networkx as nx

def make_record(gid, gtype, n, param, seed):
    if gtype == "erdos_renyi":
        G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n, param, seed=seed)
    elif gtype == "barabasi_albert":
        G = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(n, param, seed=seed)
    elif gtype == "watts_strogatz":
        k, p = param
        G = nx.watts_strogatz_graph(n, k, p, seed=seed)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported graph type: {gtype}")
    return {
        "graph_id": gid,
        "graph_type": gtype,
        "num_nodes": G.number_of_nodes(),
        "num_edges": G.number_of_edges(),
        "seed": seed,
        "edge_list": list(G.edges()),
        "node_attributes": {node: G.nodes[node] for node in G.nodes()},
    }

records = [
    make_record(1, "erdos_renyi", 100, 0.05, 42),
    make_record(2, "barabasi_albert", 100, 3, 43),
    make_record(3, "watts_strogatz", 100, (6, 0.1), 44),
]

print(f"RECORDS={len(records)}")
print("FIELDS=graph_id,graph_type,num_nodes,num_edges,seed,edge_list,node_attributes")
```

Write the loader to use this source/recipe, persist the records to the declared raw/processed data files, and DELETE any old code that fetches from a guessed website endpoint.
## Platform-owned paths written inside the project

A script in this project created `state/` inside the project directory. Those names belong to the platform, and a copy of them here is a SHADOW: the verifier resolves the paths a task names relative to this project, so it reads the shadow instead of canonical state and rejects work on the strength of a stale record.

Write your outputs under `data/`, `figures/`, `code/` and `paper/`. Do not record artifact hashes, run state or project status yourself — the platform owns `state/` and derives hashes at verification time. Delete the directories listed above and drop whatever step created them.
