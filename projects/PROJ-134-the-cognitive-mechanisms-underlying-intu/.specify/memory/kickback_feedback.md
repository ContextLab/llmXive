# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T013` (rejected 1x): The required `state/mdes_report.yaml` file is absent, causing the script to raise a `FileNotFoundError`, and the expected output `data/processed/synthetic_mfq.csv` was not generated. Consequently the deliverable CSV does not exist, so the task’s validation criteria are not met.

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
