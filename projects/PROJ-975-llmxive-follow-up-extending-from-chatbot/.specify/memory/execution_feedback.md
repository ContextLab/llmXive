# Execution failures — fix these before the analysis can run

The analysis code was EXECUTED end-to-end (per quickstart.md) and FAILED. The project cannot reach research_complete until the run-book runs cleanly AND produces its declared data/figure artifacts. Fix the ROOT CAUSE of each failure below — do not stub, do not fake outputs, do not mark a task done until its script actually runs and writes its real output.

**Summary**: 1 run-book script(s) missing (plan/impl path mismatch): python code/analysis.py --input data/results/metrics.csv; 1 command(s) failed: python code/generate_data.py --seed 42 --overlap high (rc=-1); 2 declared deliverable(s) absent: data/raw/skills.json; data/raw/tasks.json

## Failing / missing run-book commands

## Declared deliverables still missing

- data/raw/skills.json
- data/raw/tasks.json

## Declared deliverables NOT produced — make the run-book produce them

Every command may exit 0 yet a declared data/figure file is still absent. Fix the producing script to WRITE it to the exact declared path, and ensure that script is INVOKED by the quickstart run-book (you may edit quickstart.md to add the command).

- `data/raw/skills.json` is declared but was NOT written. Scripts referencing it:
    - `code/agent.py` — IS a run-book command
    - `code/generate_data.py` — IS a run-book command
    - `code/run_baseline.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
    - `code/run_experiment.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
  Make ONE of these WRITE `data/raw/skills.json` to that EXACT path. If its producing script is not a run-book command, ADD `python <source-path>.py` to quickstart.md so the run-book invokes it.
- `data/raw/tasks.json` is declared but was NOT written. Scripts referencing it:
    - `code/agent.py` — IS a run-book command
    - `code/generate_data.py` — IS a run-book command
    - `code/run_baseline.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
    - `code/run_experiment.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
    - `code/run_sensitivity.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
  Make ONE of these WRITE `data/raw/tasks.json` to that EXACT path. If its producing script is not a run-book command, ADD `python <source-path>.py` to quickstart.md so the run-book invokes it.
