# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T001` (rejected 1x): No evidence of the required directories (`code/`, `data/`, `tests/`, `state/`) is provided; the response contains only a feature specification and no actual project structure artifacts.
- `T003` (rejected 1x): No linting or formatting configuration files (e.g., `pyproject.toml` with Black settings, `.ruff.toml` or `ruff.toml` entries) were provided, nor any evidence that Ruff and Black have been set up and integrated into the project. The required artifacts to demonstrate the configuration are missing.
- `T004` (rejected 1x): declared artifact(s) missing/empty/invalid: schema.yaml
- `T005` (rejected 1x): declared artifact(s) missing/empty/invalid: schema.yaml
- `T006` (rejected 1x): declared artifact(s) missing/empty/invalid: schema.yaml

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
