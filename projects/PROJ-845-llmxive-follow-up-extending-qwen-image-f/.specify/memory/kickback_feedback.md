# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T012` (rejected 1x): No code changes to `logic_generator.py`, no generated dataset, and no metadata flags or statistical validation are present. The required artifact (the updated generator script and the ≥3,000 samples partitioned into High‑Entropy, Low‑Entropy, and Target‑Specific subsets) is missing, so the task is not satisfied.

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
