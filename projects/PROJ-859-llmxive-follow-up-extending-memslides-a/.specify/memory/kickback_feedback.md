# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T005` (rejected 1x): The `code/contracts/__init__.py` defines a `TraceValidator` that attempts to load `trace.schema.yaml`, but the required `trace.schema.yaml` file is absent from the repository, so the validation logic cannot actually operate. The missing schema file must be added for the implementation to be functional.

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
