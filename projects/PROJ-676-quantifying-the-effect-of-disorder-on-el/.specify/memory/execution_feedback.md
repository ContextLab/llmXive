# Execution failures — fix these before the analysis can run

## ⛔ HOLLOW RESULTS — the analysis RAN but MEASURED NOTHING

Every command exited 0 and the files were written — but the numbers in them are missing. A result that is `null`, `NaN`, an empty `[]`, a header-only CSV, or a column left blank in every row is NOT a measurement. Writing an empty result file is not 'done' — it is the same failure as fabrication, just quieter. You MUST:

1. Find WHY the value is missing. A `null`/`NaN` correlation almost always means the inputs were empty, misaligned, or the wrong column was read — fix the computation, do NOT paper over it with a default.
2. Verify you loaded the REAL dataset the spec names. If the study is about behavioural confidence ratings, a stand-in dataset (a bundled sklearn toy set, a random frame) is NOT the data — it will produce exactly these null/NaN results.
3. Make sure the key measure is actually POPULATED before you compute on it: if the column the study depends on is blank in every row, the extraction step is broken and that is the real bug.
4. NEVER self-certify. A `{"status": "PASS"}` written by your own code proves nothing; the numbers must be there.

- every produced artifact is gitignored (data/processed/scaling_fits.json) — the run left NO durable evidence: nothing is committed for a reviewer to inspect or a paper to cite. Write the results a reader needs (e.g. data/results/*, figures/*) outside the ignored data/raw + data/processed dataset caches.

The analysis code was EXECUTED end-to-end (per quickstart.md) and FAILED. The project cannot reach research_complete until the run-book runs cleanly AND produces its declared data/figure artifacts. Fix the ROOT CAUSE of each failure below — do not stub, do not fake outputs, do not mark a task done until its script actually runs and writes its real output.

**Summary**: every produced artifact is gitignored (data/processed/scaling_fits.json) — the run left NO durable evidence: nothing is committed for a reviewer to inspect or a paper to cite. Write the results a reader needs (e.g. data/results/*, figures/*) outside the ignored data/raw + data/processed dataset caches.; 2 declared deliverable(s) absent: data/metadata/residuals.json; data/processed/bonferroni_results.json

## Failing / missing run-book commands

- (no per-command failures; the run produced no real data/figure artifacts — ensure scripts WRITE their declared outputs under data/ and figures/)

## Declared deliverables still missing

- data/metadata/residuals.json
- data/processed/bonferroni_results.json

## Declared deliverables NOT produced — make the run-book produce them

Every command may exit 0 yet a declared data/figure file is still absent. Fix the producing script to WRITE it to the exact declared path, and ensure that script is INVOKED by the quickstart run-book (you may edit quickstart.md to add the command).

- `data/metadata/residuals.json` is declared but was NOT written. Scripts referencing it:
    - `code/logger_utils.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
    - `code/stats.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
    - `code/config.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
    - `code/logger.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
    - `code/residual_logger.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
    - `code/power_analysis.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
  Make ONE of these WRITE `data/metadata/residuals.json` to that EXACT path. If its producing script is not a run-book command, ADD `python code/<script>.py` to quickstart.md so the run-book invokes it.
- `data/processed/bonferroni_results.json` is declared but was NOT written. Scripts referencing it:
    - `code/apply_bonferroni.py` — NOT invoked by the run-book
  Make ONE of these WRITE `data/processed/bonferroni_results.json` to that EXACT path. If its producing script is not a run-book command, ADD `python code/<script>.py` to quickstart.md so the run-book invokes it.
