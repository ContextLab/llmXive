# Re-plan: task(s) could not be made to pass verification — adjust the approach

The implementer repeatedly failed the verification checks for the task(s) below. They were NOT force-accepted (that fail-open was removed in issue #1139); instead the project re-plans so a DIFFERENT approach (simpler method, different tooling, or a decomposition into individually verifiable steps) can produce checkable artifacts.

## Repeatedly-unverifiable tasks

- `T003` (rejected 1x): No linting or formatting configuration files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `.flake8`, `ruff.toml`, `black.toml`, or a `pre-commit` config) are present in the provided evidence, so we cannot confirm that ruff/flake8 and black have been set up as required. The implementer must supply the actual configuration artifacts demonstrating the tools are installed and configured.

## Required change

Re-plan so each promised deliverable is produced by a step whose output can be deterministically verified (a real file with the expected schema/content). Avoid the approach that produced the unverifiable work above.
