# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for test-synthetic-timeseries-2025.

## Milestones

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Set up development environment
   - Create base infrastructure
   
2. **Phase 2: Core Development** (Weeks 3-6)
   - Implement main algorithms
   - Build API layer
   
3. **Phase 3: Testing & Optimization** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Performance optimization

## Timeline

- Week 1-2: Environment setup and base infrastructure
- Week 3-4: Core algorithm implementation
- Week 5-6: API development and integration
- Week 7: Testing and bug fixes
- Week 8: Documentation and deployment

## Resource Requirements

- 2 senior developers
- 1 ML engineer
- Access to GPU cluster for training
- 100GB storage for datasets

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. Algorithm complexity - Mitigation: Prototype early
2. Scalability issues - Mitigation: Load test continuously

### Schedule Risks
1. Dependencies on external APIs - Mitigation: Mock interfaces
2. Team availability - Mitigation: Cross-training
