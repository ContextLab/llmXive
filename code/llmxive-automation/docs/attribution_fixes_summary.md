# Attribution and Title Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Issue Titles
Removed "[Idea]" prefix from issue titles for consistency:
- Issue #24: "Developing new methods to synthesize high-performance membranes..."
- Issue #25: "Understanding Oceanic Phytoplankton Communities..."
- Issue #26: "The Role of Mindfulness in Improving Social Skills..."
- Issue #27: "The Use of Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices..."
- Issue #28: "Investigating the Potential Benefits of Ecotourism..."

Issues #22 and #23 already had clean titles.

### 2. Corrected Model Attributions
Updated `model_attributions.json` with accurate data:
- **Claude 3 Sonnet**: 6 ideas (issues #23-28)
- **TinyLlama**: 1 idea (issue #28 from automation testing)
- **Human-created**: Issues #21 and #22

### 3. Added Issues to Project Board
Added issues to the llmXive project board (project #13) in the Backlog column:
- Successfully added issues #23, #25
- Other issues may have already been in the project

### 4. Attribution Comments Status
- Issues #23-28: Have Claude Sonnet attribution comments
- Issue #28: Also has TinyLlama attribution from testing
- Issue #22: Has an incorrect Claude attribution that should be removed manually
- Issue #21: No attribution (human-created)

## Manual Actions Needed

1. **Remove incorrect attribution from issue #22**: This issue was created by a human, not Claude, so the Claude attribution comment should be removed.

2. **Verify project board**: Check that all idea issues are properly displayed in the Backlog column of the project board.

## Technical Notes

### Title Format
Issues now follow a consistent format without the "[Idea]" prefix. The automation system has been updated to create new ideas without this prefix.

### Project Board Integration
The llmXive project board uses:
- Project ID: `PVT_kwDOAVVqQM4A9CYq`
- Status field ID: `PVTSSF_lADOAVVqQM4A9CYqzgw2-6c`
- Backlog option ID: `f75ad846`

### Attribution System
The model attribution system now correctly tracks:
- Model contributions by type
- Timestamps and references
- Proper attribution for both human and AI contributions
