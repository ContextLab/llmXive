# Real Tests Migration Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed All Mock-Based Tests
- Deleted `tests/unit/` directory containing all unit tests with mocks
- Removed `tests/test_all_tasks_integration.py` which used extensive mocking
- Removed `tests/integration/test_real_models.py` which mixed real models with mocks

### 2. Updated Test Infrastructure
- Rewrote `tests/conftest.py` to only include real fixtures:
  - `real_small_model`: Loads actual TinyLlama model
  - `real_github`: Uses actual GitHub API or CLI fallback
  - `real_conversation_manager`: Real conversation manager with actual model
  - `real_task_executor`: Real executor with actual components
  - `real_orchestrator`: Real orchestrator instance
  - Test workspace fixtures for file operations
  - Real attribution tracker

### 3. Created Real Integration Test Suite
- Created `tests/test_real_integration.py` with comprehensive real tests:
  - Model loading from HuggingFace
  - Real model inference
  - Real GitHub operations
  - Real task execution (brainstorming, literature search, code generation)
  - Real orchestrator runs
  - Real attribution tracking
  - Real issue creation with labels

### 4. Kept Pure Logic Tests
These tests don't use mocks and test pure logic:
- `test_model_attribution.py`: Tests attribution tracking logic
- `test_prompt_builder.py`: Tests prompt construction logic
- `test_review_parser_debug.py`: Tests response parsing logic
- `test_score_parser_debug.py`: Tests score parsing logic

## Current Status

### Working Tests
- Pure logic tests (attribution, prompt building, parsing)
- Script for fixing issue metadata uses real GitHub operations

### Known Issues
1. **Model Loading Error**: There's a transformers library compatibility issue with TinyLlama model loading on CPU. The error occurs in the transformers library's post_init method when checking tensor parallelism plans.

2. **Workaround Options**:
   - Use a different small model that's compatible
   - Update transformers library
   - Run tests on a machine with GPU
   - Skip model-dependent tests temporarily

## How to Run Tests

### Run Pure Logic Tests Only
```bash
pytest tests/test_model_attribution.py tests/test_prompt_builder.py -v
```

### Run Real Integration Tests (when model loading is fixed)
```bash
pytest tests/test_real_integration.py -v -s -m integration
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Model Loading**: 
   - Try updating transformers library: `pip install --upgrade transformers`
   - Or use a different small model like "google/flan-t5-small"

2. **Complete Integration Testing**:
   - Once model loading is fixed, run full integration test suite
   - Add more comprehensive task-specific tests

3. **CI/CD Considerations**:
   - Real tests require actual model downloads and API access
   - Consider having a separate test suite for CI that uses smaller models
   - Set up proper test credentials for GitHub access

## Benefits of Real Tests

1. **No Mock Maintenance**: No need to update mocks when APIs change
2. **Real Validation**: Tests actually validate the system works with real services
3. **Better Coverage**: Tests cover actual integration points and edge cases
4. **More Confidence**: When tests pass, we know the system actually works
