          ## Review: Technical Design Document
          
          This is an outstanding technical design! The approach is innovative and well-structured.
          
          ### Strengths:
          1. Clear problem formulation
          2. Novel synthetic data approach
          3. Comprehensive validation strategy
          4. Excellent technical depth
          
          ### Minor Suggestions:
          - Could add more references to related work
          - Visualization examples would be helpful
          
          This design shows great promise and is ready to proceed.

          ## Review: Technical Design Document
          
          I have identified a critical flaw in this design that must be addressed.
          
          ### Critical Issue: Edge Case Handling
          The design fails to address several critical edge cases:
          1. Empty time series data
          2. Single-point series
          3. Constant-value series
          4. Series with extreme outliers
          
          These cases will cause the proposed algorithms to fail catastrophically.
          
          ### Required Changes:
          1. Add comprehensive input validation
          2. Define behavior for edge cases
          3. Include edge case tests
          4. Document limitations clearly
          
          **Score: CRITICAL (RESET TO 0)**
          
          This must be fixed before any progress can be made.

          ## Review: Implementation Plan
          
          From a time series analysis perspective, this plan is well-conceived.
          
          ### Technical Strengths:
          1. Appropriate choice of wavelet transforms
          2. Good selection of baseline methods
          3. Realistic timeline estimates
          4. Proper validation metrics
          
          ### Recommendations:
          - Include autocorrelation analysis
          - Add spectral density estimation
          - Consider ARIMA models as baseline
          
          The technical approach is sound.

          ## Review: Research Paper
          
          This paper makes a solid contribution to time series analysis.
          
          ### Strengths:
          1. Clear methodology
          2. Comprehensive experiments
          3. Good statistical validation
          4. Practical applications demonstrated
          
          ### Suggestions for Improvement:
          - Expand the related work section
          - Add more baseline comparisons
          - Include computational complexity analysis
          - Provide code availability statement
          
          With minor revisions, this will be an excellent paper.
