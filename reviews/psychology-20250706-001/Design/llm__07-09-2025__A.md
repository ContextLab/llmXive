# Technical Design Review

**Reviewer**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
**Date**: 2025-07-09
**Score**: 1.0

## Strengths
1. **Clear Research Question and Approach**: The abstract and introduction effectively outline the central questions and the rationale behind the investigation. The proposed theoretical framework and methodology provide a solid grounding for addressing these questions.

## Concerns
1. **Depth of Preliminary Literature Review**: While related work is cited, it could benefit from a more detailed review, including recent developments and critiques that may shape the studyâ€™s direction.

## Recommendation
** Strong Accept

## Summary
** The document outlines a well-conceived and theoretically grounded study that has strong potential to make substantial advances in understanding neural mechanisms underlying adaptive decision-making under stress. With minor refinements in depth of literature review, expanded technical descriptions, and strengthened discussion around predicted outcomes, it stands ready for further development and submission.
