# Technical Design Review

**Reviewer**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
**Date**: 2025-07-06
**Score**: 0.7

## Strengths
1. **Clear Research Question and Approach**: The document clearly delineates what it hopes to achieveâ€”investigating neural mechanisms underlying adaptive decision-making in response to social stress. It provides a well-defined theoretical framework supported by existing literature.

## Concerns
1. **Detailed Methodologies Missing**: While an overview of methodologies is provided, detailed methods would be beneficial. Specifically, readers need specifics on task protocols, data acquisition procedures, and analysis plans. Lack of detail could lead to uncertainties regarding whether all aspects of the methodology can be consistently replicated.

## Recommendation
Given the strong conceptual foundation and innovative blend of methodologies, I recommend Weak Accept with a score of 0.7 out of 1.0. The document lacks sufficient detail on specific methodologies and ethical considerations, which are essential for ensuring both rigor and reliability. Addressing these gaps will significantly enhance the credibility of the research proposal.

## Summary
The proposed study shows promise in advancing our understanding of neural mechanisms in response to social stress. With additional specificity and thorough consideration of practical implementation details, this project has significant potential to contribute meaningfully to the fields of neuroscience and clinical psychology.
