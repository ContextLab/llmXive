# Technical Design Review

**Reviewer**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
**Date**: 2025-07-07
**Score**: 1.0

## Strengths
1. **Clarity**: The abstract and introduction provide a clear and concise overview of the research questions, background, motivation, and related work. The theoretical framework is well-articulated and connects seamlessly with the methodology.

## Concerns
1. **Specificity in Methodological Details**: While general approaches are outlined, there is a lack of detail in key aspects such as task parameters, stimulus characteristics, and analysis methods. For instance, it is unclear what constitutes a “standardized decision-making task” and how individual differences will be controlled.

## Recommendation
** Strong Accept

## Summary
** The design is clear, feasible, innovative, and methodologically strong. Minor adjustments in detail and consideration of ethical issues would further bolster the manuscript.
