# Technical Design Review

**Reviewer**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
**Date**: 2025-07-08
**Score**: 0.3

## Strengths
1. **Clear Research Question Definition**: The introduction section does an excellent job defining the core research questions and motivation behind the study. It clearly states the goal of identifying atmospheric compositions, temperatures, and dynamics with high precision.

## Concerns
1. **Incomplete Sections**: The abstract is cut off mid-sentence, and sections such as “Introduction” and subsequent details are abruptly truncated. This makes some parts hard to follow and review comprehensively.

## Recommendation
**Weak Accept**

## Summary
The technical design document sets out a promising direction in exoplanet atmosphere characterization, articulating a strong vision and preliminary methodology. To elevate its appeal and credibility, the authors should fill in gaps and specify technical details while maintaining the integrity of their innovative approach.
