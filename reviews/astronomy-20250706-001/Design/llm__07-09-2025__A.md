# Technical Design Review

**Reviewer**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
**Date**: 2025-07-09
**Score**: 0.3

## Strengths
1. **Clear Objectives**: The abstract and introduction clearly outline the main research questions and goals. The authors define what they intend to achieve by identifying atmospheric constituents, pressures, temperatures, and chemical processes.

## Concerns
1. **Incomplete Information**: Several parts of the text are truncated, which makes it difficult to evaluate the depth of detail and completeness of the research plan. This includes areas such as the specifics of spectroscopic techniques, exact computational methods used, and details about the expected outcomes of experiments.

## Recommendation
Given the strengths outlined above, I would recommend a **Weak Accept** with a **Score of 0.3**.

## Summary
#### Strengths:
1. **Clear Objectives**: The abstract and introduction clearly outline the main research questions and goals. The authors define what they intend to achieve by identifying atmospheric ...
