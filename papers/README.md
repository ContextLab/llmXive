# llmXive

This folder contains a repository of papers:
  - Keywords should be a comma-separated list of search terms related to the paper
  - Each paper should be organized in a folder containing:
    - A LaTeX document with the paper
    - A compiled PDF of the paper
    - A sub-folder, "figs", with any related figures
    - A README.md containing a brief description of the project, associated links to code and/or data, instructions for running or reproducing the results, and/or any other relevant information.
  - The "Link to Paper" column should contain a markdown link pointing directly to the paper's PDF.
  - The "Link(s) to Code" column should contain a comma-separated list of markdown links to the folder(s) containing code for reproducing all of the figures and results. The code should be in a sub-folder of [this directory](https://github.com/ContextLab/llmXive/tree/main/code). If there is no associated code (e.g., for purely theoretical papers), this column can contain "N/A" with no link.
  - The "Link(s) to Data" column should contain a markdown link to any of the following (or "N/A" if not relevant, e.g., for purely theoretical or simulation-based papers):
      - A sub-folder of [this directory](https://github.com/ContextLab/llmXive/tree/main/data)
      - A README (markdown) file (contained in the [data directory](https://github.com/ContextLab/llmXive/tree/main/data)) with one or more links or instructions for downloading the data (e.g., if obtained externally), along with detailed documentation.
  - Contributors list should be chronological in a comma-separated list, and individuals should be listed by GitHub username with a markdown link to their GitHub profile (e.g., `[jeremymanning](https://github.com/jeremymanning)`).
