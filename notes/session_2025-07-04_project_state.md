# llmXive Project State - 2025-07-04

## Overview
llmXive is an automated system for scientific discovery driven by LLMs with occasional human input. The project follows a structured workflow with GitHub issues tracked through project board columns.

## Current Status

### Recent Activity
- **Latest commits**: Focus on web interface fixes (OAuth, status detection, board UI)
- **Active development**: llmXive Automation System (Issue #21) - a meta-project to fully automate the research pipeline
- **No active papers**: Both In-Progress and Completed tables in papers directory are empty

### Project Structure
1. **Backlog**: 22 open issues covering various AI/cognitive science topics
2. **Ready**: No items currently marked as ready (need 5+ review points)
3. **In Progress**: No items currently in progress
4. **Done**: No completed projects yet

### Key Directories
- `technical_design_documents/`: Contains 1 design doc (llmXive automation)
- `code/`: Contains llmxive-automation codebase with Python toolbox
- `papers/`: Empty (no papers started)
- `reviews/`: Structure exists but no reviews yet
- `data/`: Structure exists but no datasets
- `implementation_plans/`: Empty

### llmXive Automation System (llmxive-auto-001)
- **Status**: In Backlog
- **Purpose**: Automate entire scientific discovery process
- **Implementation**: Python package with CLI and GitHub Actions support
- **Components**:
  - Model selector (HuggingFace integration)
  - Task orchestrator
  - GitHub manager
  - Prompt builder
  - Test suite included

## Areas Needing Attention

1. **No Active Reviews**: No technical design documents have been reviewed yet
2. **No Papers Started**: Despite 22 ideas in backlog, no papers have been initiated
3. **Point System Not Active**: No issues have point labels tracking review scores
4. **Automation System Needs Testing**: The automation framework exists but needs validation

## Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Start Reviews**: Begin reviewing the llmXive automation technical design document
2. **Test Automation**: Run the automation system locally to validate functionality
3. **Initialize Point Tracking**: Add point labels to issues as reviews are completed
4. **Select First Paper**: Choose one of the backlog ideas to develop into first paper
5. **Document Progress**: Continue session notes as work progresses

## Technical Notes
- Repository is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Main branch is current
- Web interface appears functional with recent fixes
