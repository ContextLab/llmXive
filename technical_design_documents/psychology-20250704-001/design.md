Title: The Role of Mindfulness in Improving Social Skills Among Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

Field: Psychology

Keywords: Mindfulness, Improving, Social, Skills, Children

Abstract

This research seeks to investigate the role of mindfulness in enhancing social skills among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Specifically, it examines whether mindfulness practice can improve social interaction, communication, and emotion regulation among children with ASD. The proposed methodology utilizes a randomized controlled trial design, involving 60 children aged 8-12 years who meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a control group or a mindfulness intervention group. The intervention will consist of eight sessions of guided meditation and mindfulness training, delivered by trained facilitators. The primary outcome measure will be self-reported measures of social competence, including social interaction ratings and parent report scores on social behavior. Secondary outcomes will include changes in cognitive processing, emotional regulation, and social perceptions. The study will also explore the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention through qualitative data analysis.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication, social interaction, and behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Children with ASD often demonstrate difficulties in socializing, communicating, and interacting with others (Kramer et al., 2017). These difficulties may result from both genetic and environmental factors, but the impact of these factors is complex and multifactorial (Faraone & Van Hoeydonck, 2019). Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to promote positive developmental outcomes across diverse populations, including children with ASD (Cohen, Fiore, Kerns, McDonald, & Kumanyika, 2016; Faraone & Van Hoeydonck, 2019).

The present research seeks to investigate the role of mindfulness in enhancing social skills among children with ASD. The findings from this research will provide insights into the potential benefits of mindfulness for children with ASD and may inform the development of more effective mindfulness interventions for this population.

Methodology Overview

The proposed research utilizes a randomized controlled trial design with a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Participants will be recruited from three schools in the local community. The sample size is estimated at 60 children aged 8-12 years who meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: a mindfulness intervention group or a control group. In the intervention group, participants will receive eight sessions of guided meditation and mindfulness training. The program will be delivered by trained facilitators who have completed an approved mindfulness-based intervention course. The program will consist of four modules, each consisting of three sessions (total of 12 sessions). The first module will focus on mindfulness meditation techniques, such as body scan and breath awareness. The second module will introduce relaxation and mindfulness techniques for managing stress. The third module will address social skills training, focusing on social cues, nonverbal communication, and communication strategies. The fourth module will address practical skills, such as active listening, sharing, and conflict resolution. A pretest-posttest design will be used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention over time. Participants will complete standardized questionnaires assessing social competence, including measures of social interaction, communication, and emotion regulation (Barr, Bem, & Lohse, 2016). Other measures will include self-report questionnaires assessing cognitive processing (e.g., working memory), emotional regulation (e.g., self-regulated learning), and social behavior (e.g., peer interactions).

Technical Innovations

The proposed intervention will incorporate various mindfulness techniques into a structured program. For example, the meditation component will use guided visualization techniques to help participants quiet their minds and become aware of their own thoughts and feelings. The relaxation component will involve progressive muscle relaxation and breath awareness techniques. The social skill training component will focus on teaching participants strategies for engaging in healthy social interactions and developing emotional regulation skills.

Implementation Strategy

Participants will be recruited from three schools in the local community. Randomization will be conducted using a computerized program, with a block design. In the intervention group, participants will be randomized to either the treatment or control group. Participants in the control group will not receive the intervention. Data collection will take place prior to the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and at follow-up. The data collected will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and independent samples t-tests.

Evaluation Plan

The primary outcome measure will be changes in social competence, measured using standardized scales such as the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (Rutter et al., 1993) and the Autism-Quotient (AQ) (Lichtenstein, 2002). The secondary outcome measures will include changes in cognitive processing, emotional regulation, and social behavior. Participants in the control group will serve as a comparison group, allowing us to compare the effects of the intervention to those of no intervention. Participants will be assessed before and after the intervention to evaluate changes in cognition, emotional regulation, and social behavior.

Timeline and Milestones

Data collection will begin in early 2021 and end in late 2021. Analysis of data will begin in late 2021 and will continue until early 2022. The results of the study will be presented at a national conference in early 2023.
