### Neural Mechanisms Underlying Adaptive Decision-Making in Response to Social Stress

#### Abstract
This study aims to investigate the neural mechanisms involved in adaptive decision-making responses to social stress using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with behavioral tasks. The goal is to understand how individuals adapt their cognitive processes and emotional reactions in stressful social situations, which can inform therapeutic strategies for conditions like anxiety disorders.

#### Introduction

##### Background and Motivation
Social stressors have profound impacts on mental health, influencing decision-making processes through complex interactions between psychological, physiological, and neurobiological factors. Current models of decision-making often focus on intrinsic variables but ignore the role of external stimuli such as social pressure. This gap limits our understanding of how optimal decisions can be made under challenging circumstances. By focusing on the brain's adaptive responses to social stress, we aim to develop new insights into the neural basis of resilient decision-making.

##### Related Work
Previous studies by researchers such as [Smith et al., 2018] and [Johnson & Doe, 2020] have explored the neural correlates of stress perception and its impact on emotion regulation. However, these studies did not specifically address adaptive decision-making or the integration of environmental cues into cognitive processing.

##### Research Questions
1. What neural circuits mediate adaptive decision-making under social stress?
2. How do individual differences in personality traits influence neural responses to social stress?
3. Can interventions targeting these neural pathways enhance resilience in response to future stress?

#### Proposed Approach

##### Theoretical Framework
The proposed approach integrates theories from neuroscience, psychophysiology, and clinical psychology. We hypothesize that adaptive decision-making involves dynamic interactions between prefrontal cortex regions responsible for executive functions, amygdala for emotion regulation, and striatum for reward processing. These regions work together to integrate information about social context into ongoing decision-making processes.

##### Methodology Overview
We will employ a combination of fMRI scanning during laboratory-based behavioral tasks and computational modeling techniques. Participants will undergo two types of tasks: one involving mild social stressors (e.g., public speaking), and another control condition without stress exposure. During both sessions, participants will complete standardized decision-making tasks while undergoing continuous fMRI scans.

##### Technical Innovations
Key technical innovations include:
1. **Real-time fMRI Analysis**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to provide real-time feedback on neural activity patterns.
2. **Multivariate Pattern Analysis**: Utilizing advanced statistical methods to identify unique neural signatures associated with adaptive versus maladaptive decision-making.
3. **Integration of Computational Models**: Incorporating generative models to simulate neural dynamics and test hypotheses about decision-making under stress.

#### Implementation Strategy

##### Key Components
1. **FMRIB Software Library (FSL)**: For preprocessing and analysis of MRI data.
